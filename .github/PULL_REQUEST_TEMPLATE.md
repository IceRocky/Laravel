**IMPORTANT NOTE**
I'll be out of town until August 1st. I have a couple people checking the repo to make sure there's nothing urgent to fix, but other than that, I'll be back in and active next week. Thanks!

1Ô∏è‚É£ Is this something that is wanted/needed? Did you create a feature-request issue first?

2Ô∏è‚É£ Does it contain multiple, unrelated changes? Please separate the PRs out.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Does it include tests if possible? (Not a deal-breaker, just a nice-to-have)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Please include a thorough description of the feature/fix and reasons why it's useful.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Thanks for contributing! üôå
