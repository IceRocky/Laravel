Livewire allows you to nest components, creating a parent-child relationship between them. Nesting components can be helpful in breaking down complex UIs into smaller, more manageable pieces. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of nesting components and discuss how to pass data between parent and child components.

## Creating Nested Components

To create a nested component, simply include the child component's Blade directive within the parent component's Blade template. For example, let's say you have a parent component called `ParentComponent` and a child component called `ChildComponent`. To nest `ChildComponent` inside `ParentComponent`, add the `@livewire` directive for `ChildComponent` in the `ParentComponent`'s Blade template:

```html
<!-- parent-component.blade.php -->
<div>
    <h1>Parent Component</h1>
    @livewire('child-component')
</div>
```

Now, the `ChildComponent` will be rendered as a part of the `ParentComponent`.

## Passing Data from Parent to Child

You can pass data from the parent component to the child component using the second parameter of the `@livewire` directive:

```html
<!-- parent-component.blade.php -->
<div>
    <h1>Parent Component</h1>
    @livewire('child-component', ['data' => $parentData])
</div>
```

In your child component, you can access the passed data by defining a public property with the same name:

```php
use Livewire\Component;

class ChildComponent extends Component
{
    public $data;

    public function mount($data)
    {
        $this->data = $data;
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Emitting Events from Child to Parent

To pass data or trigger actions from the child component to the parent component, you can use Livewire's event system. In your child component, emit an event using the `emit()` or `emitUp()` methods:

```php
use Livewire\Component;

class ChildComponent extends Component
{
    public function triggerParentAction()
    {
        $this->emit('childActionTriggered', 'Some data from child component');
    }

    // ...
}
```

In your parent component, listen for the event by adding the `listeners` property and specifying the method that should be called when the event is received:

```php
use Livewire\Component;

class ParentComponent extends Component
{
    protected $listeners = ['childActionTriggered' => 'handleChildAction'];

    public function handleChildAction($childData)
    {
        // Process the data received from the child component
    }

    // ...
}
```

With this setup, when the `triggerParentAction()` method is called in the `ChildComponent`, the `handleChildAction()` method in the `ParentComponent` will be executed, receiving the data passed from the child component.

Nesting components in Livewire allows you to create modular and reusable UI components, making it easier to manage complex interfaces. By passing data between parent and child components and using the event system, you can create a flexible and maintainable structure for your application's UI.
